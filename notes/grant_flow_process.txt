Yes, that's a valid approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Check Access Token**: Verify if the access token is still valid by checking its expiration time. If the access token is still valid, proceed with making API requests using it.

2. **If Access Token is Expired or Invalid**:
   - Attempt to refresh the access token using the refresh token.
   - If the refresh token is valid, use it to obtain a new access token through the token refresh flow.
   - If the refresh token is expired or invalid, the user needs to re-authenticate using the authorization code grant flow.

3. **Perform Authorization Code Grant Flow**:
   - Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint to obtain a new authorization code.
   - Exchange the authorization code for a new set of tokens, including a new access token and refresh token.
   - Save the new tokens securely for future use.

4. **Retry API Request with New Access Token**:
   - After obtaining a new access token (either through refreshing or re-authenticating), retry the original API request that required the access token.
   - Ensure that you handle any errors gracefully and inform the user if the request fails permanently.

5. **Handle Errors**:
   - If any step in the process fails (e.g., refresh token expired, refresh token grant fails, authorization code grant fails), handle the error appropriately.
   - Provide clear error messages to the user and guide them on how to resolve the issue (e.g., re-authenticate, contact support).

6. **Repeat as Necessary**:
   - Depending on the requirements of your application and the API you're accessing, you may need to repeat this process each time the access token expires or becomes invalid.

This approach ensures that your application can maintain continuous access to the API resources while handling token expiration and refreshing as needed.
